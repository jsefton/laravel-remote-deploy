This package allows you to define a remote server and directory that you can then push your changes to with a simple command directly from your local.

### TODO
- Create service provider to register command
- Find or create SSH package for remote connection
- Build ability to create custom defined commands / tasks to be ran on a 'build'
- Include Migrate Environments package to allow easy database updating with deploy
- Enable multiple environments / remote targets to be defined
